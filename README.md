****NOTICE: 1EdTech will be moving Caliper to private repositories on June 17, 2023. Access to the repositories will be available for 1EdTech Contributing Members and Affiliates.  We encourage you to get involved in 1EdTech to support the Caliper work and get certified for Caliper.****

# caliper-java
The [Caliper Analytics® Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/caliper/v1p1/caliper-spec-v1p1) 
provides a structured approach to describing, collecting and exchanging learning activity data at 
scale. Caliper also defines an application programming interface (the Sensor API™) for marshalling 
and transmitting event data from instrumented applications to target endpoints for storage, 
analysis and use.  

*caliper-java* is a reference implementation of the Sensor API™ written in Javas.

## Branches
* __master__: stable, deployable branch that stores the official release history.  
* __develop__: unstable development branch.  Current work that targets a future release is merged 
to this branch.

## Tags
*caliper-java* releases are tagged and versioned MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH\[-label\] (e.g., 1.1.1). 
Pre-release tags are identified with an extensions label (e.g., "1.2.0-RC01").  The tags are stored 
in this repository.

## Contributing
We welcome the posting of issues by non IMS Global Learning Consortium members (e.g., feature 
requests, bug reports, questions, etc.) but we *do not* accept contributions in the form of pull 
requests from non-members. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for more 
information.

## Getting Started
Fork the IMS Global *caliper-java* project to your Github account and then clone your copy to your 
local development machine.  

### Prerequisites
*caliper-java* uses Apache [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.x to manage the build process, 
documentation and reporting.

### Building
First, clone the *caliper-common-fixtures* project to your development machine and add a symbolic 
link: 

```
ln -s /Path/to/caliper-common-fixtures/src/test/resources/fixtures/ src/test/resources/fixtures
``` 

Then from your local *caliper-java* directory run:

```
mvn clean install
```

You can also build a jar with all the dependencies compiled by invoking the `uber-jar` build 
profile:

```
mvn clean -P uber-jar install
```

This will create a jar in: `target/caliper-java-{version}.jar`

### Dependency Management
You can specify *caliper-java* as a project or module dependency in the appropriate `pom.xml` file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.imsglobal.caliper</groupId>
    <artifactId>caliper-java</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.2</version>
</dependency>
```
